## Class CalculateGeoDistance & CalculateMagenticDeviation

We can use class CalculateGeoDistance to calculate the distance and map
courses between two positions. To get the compass course, we need to
consider the __magnetic declination__ and __magnetic deviation__. In
Main, with two names of the position, we can get the map course,
nautical mile and compass course

## Add RestfulAPI for the application
